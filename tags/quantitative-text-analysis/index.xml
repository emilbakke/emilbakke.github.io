      <description>The Hoover Institution recently finished digitizing 586 Nazi biograms collected by Theodore Abel, professor of sociology at Columbia University from 1929 to 1950. Abel gathered these documents a year after Hitler&amp;rsquo;s appointment as chancellor by setting up a contest offering 400 German marks &amp;ldquo;for the best personal life history of an adherent of the Hitler movement.&amp;rdquo; The collection which represents a sample of 2.5% of early NSDAP members forms the basis for Abel&amp;rsquo;s insightful book Why Hitler Came Into Power published in 1938.</description>
